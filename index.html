            <h1>A short introduction to my dog.</h1>
            <p>This is my dog Phil, he is a mix between a Boston Terrier and a Chihuahua. He is around 7 years old, his actual age is unknown due to him being a rescue but, we do know that we adopted him when he was at least a year old. Being a mix between two relatively small breeds he isn't very formidable when it comes to physical stature, he weighs in at a complete average of 13 pounds. Although this does not seem all too impressive for a dog of this size it is quite an accomplishment as he is incredibly spoiled when it comes to the food department. He is obviously taken care of very well on day-to-day bases when it comes to standard meals but boy oh boy he gets a copious amount of treats and special attention, I mean the boy gets his own egg platter every week. Enough ranting about my dog's weight what is he actually like? Well, he is remarkably lazy, my man loves to sit and lounge all day, every day, especially if the sun is out. Any elevated soft surface is his and his alone, and if there isn't one around he will somehow create one by dragging pillows around, it's honestly really impressive.</p>
