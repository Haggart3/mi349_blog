                <h2>A short introduction to my dog.</h2>

                        <p>This is my dog Phil, he is a mix between a Boston Terrier and a Chihuahua. He is around 7 years old, his actual age is unknown due to him being a rescue but, we do know that we adopted him when he was at least a year old. Being a mix between two relatively small breeds he isn't very formidable when it comes to physical stature, he weighs in at a complete average of 13 pounds. Although this does not seem all too impressive for a dog of this size it is quite an accomplishment as he is incredibly spoiled when it comes to the food department. He is obviously taken care of very well on day-to-day bases when it comes to standard meals but boy oh boy he gets a copious amount of treats and special attention, I mean the boy gets his own egg platter every week. Enough ranting about my dog's weight what is he actually like? Well, he is remarkably lazy, my man loves to sit and lounge all day, every day, especially if the sun is out. Any elevated soft surface is his and his alone, and if there isn't one around he will somehow create one by dragging pillows around, it's honestly really impressive.</p>

                <h2>Why hasn't there been any good movies out recently?: an overly opinionated take on the last few weeks of Cinema</h2>
                <p>I frequent the movies; some would say too much, but beyond school and work, I honestly have nothing better to do. The past 4-5 times I have been the movies have been meh at best with ONE exception. What is going on at the moment? Usually, January-February is the month for sub-par films but never around now. Historically studios pump the fall months with high concept, oscar bait, and while some of the movies coming out right now are exactly that *cough* Amsterdam *cough* the mark still isn't hit. Not saying movies like that are supposed to be good (In the case of Amsterdam and Don't Worry Darling I didn't have high expectations) but, it's just the fact that there is such a concentration of meh in the cinema scene right now. On top of the typical fall season Oscar bait there are your bog-standard horror pictures, which there is absolutely nothing wrong with it's just such a weird time at the movies currently. Like we usually get at least one OKAY horror movie every fall season but this year, nothing (and I am not counting Hocus Pocus 2 that kinda lives in a weird limbo of genre in my opinion).</p>
